This could either be through moving the unstarted work to a new epic and calling the current epic Done, through reverting whatever changes were already shipped and cancelling the epic, or perhaps something else that allows us to tie a neat bow on the work we've done so far.\n\nKeeping an on hold epic in a Started state reminds us that we've got some unresolved tidying to do, which is good.",
